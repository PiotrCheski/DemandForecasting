Company X is engaged in the sale of various products through its online store. Their IT system records transaction information in a .csv file for each product purchase, including:

    Transaction date
    Category to which the sold product belongs
    Product name
    Quantity of the product purchased in a given transaction
    Price per unit of the product
    Transaction value

The accumulated transaction data can be the basis for conducting business analyses regarding the sale of products in the online store. Unfortunately, Company X does not have a tool that would allow visualization of the accumulated data or forecasting of product demand. The project's goal is to enable Company X to:

    Forecast demand for products offered in their online store
    Visualize data related to the sale of products.
